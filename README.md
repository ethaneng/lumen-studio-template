This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# Project Overview
This website for **Lumen Studio** has been created to reflect a modern, refined, and minimal aesthetic, in line with the brand’s focus on sophistication and elegance.

The goal of this project is to take the provided design and convert it into a one-page landing page based on the [provided design](https://www.figma.com/design/zhXjH7w9LjAmDrmm9Ht1qf/Lumen-Studio---Website-Design-File?node-id=2001-228&m=dev).
## Deliverables
*   1-Page layout that matches the layout and design provided as close as possible. Please use the Figma link above to view the design.
*   You should send us a repository of your work along with a link to a deployed version of your project (ideally hosted via Vercel).
*   The site should be developed to be fully responsive and you should adjust the structure as needed.
*   You should incorporate animations into the site where possible. Animation libraries we want to see implemented are listed below so please make use of them.
*   The design and template are not final and includes some intentional imperfections, which should be taken into account during the development process.
*   The code should be documented and structured code, ideally with your components organised into folders based on how you make use of them.
*   Consideration made on how you could make this project scalable. We wont require the site to be connected to a content management system, however all of our sites will use some kind of CMS so we expect that to be a consideration.
*   SEO best practices should be considered when you are structuring your code. We have included a robots.txt file with disallow all so you can freely deploy to Vercel without concern.
*   The contact form should be set up to prepare the content for sending however, it should be configured to just log the data to the console as oppose to sending an email.
## Provided Packages
The template will contain a few packages preinstalled. These libraries we will use on a majority of our projects so we suggest you familiarise yourself with them:
*   GSAP
*   Lenis
*   Swiper
## Assets
Included in this file is the assets from the figma file pre-exported and a boilerplate Next.js project:
*   Images
*   Icons
The typography makes use of **Cormorant Garamond** for headings and **Lato** for body text, both available through Google Fonts.
