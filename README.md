# Project Overview
This website for **Lumen Studio** has been created to reflect a modern, refined, and minimal aesthetic, in line with the brand’s focus on sophistication and elegance.

The goal of this project is to take the provided design and convert it into a one-page landing page based on the [provided design](https://www.figma.com/design/zhXjH7w9LjAmDrmm9Ht1qf/Lumen-Studio---Website-Design-File?node-id=2001-228&m=dev) (you will need to sign in to Figma to properly preview the design).
## Deliverables
*   1-Page layout that matches the layout and design provided as close as possible. Please use the Figma link above to view the design.
*   You should send us a repository of your work along with a link to a deployed version of your project (ideally hosted via Vercel).
*   The site should be developed to be fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile), and you should consider the structure and make changes to ensure that responsiveness is factored in.
*   You should incorporate animations into the site where possible. We use GSAP for our animations, Lenis for smooth scrolling and Swiper for carousel elements, so we suggest making use of those libraries.
*   The design and template are not final and include some intentional imperfections, which should be taken into account during the development process.
*   Your code should be properly documented and structured, ideally with your components organised into folders, so it makes it easy to understand a project at a glance.
*   You should consider how you could make this project scalable. We won't require the site to be connected to a content management system; however, all of our sites will use some kind of CMS, so how you can take a site and ensure it can be scaled up should be considered.
*   SEO best practices should also be considered when you are structuring your code. We have included a robots.txt file with disallow all set up, to avoid the site indexing if you deploy to production.
*   The contact form should be set up to prepare the content for sending; however, it should be configured to just log the data to the console as opposed to sending an email.
## Provided Packages
The template will contain a few packages preinstalled. These libraries we will use on a majority of our projects, so we suggest you familiarise yourself with them:
*   GSAP
*   Lenis
*   Swiper
## Assets
Included in this file are the assets from the Figma file pre-exported and a boilerplate Next.js project:
*   Images
*   Icons
The typography makes use of **Cormorant Garamond** for headings and **Lato** for body text, both available through Google Fonts.
